# paper2lkg
A Local Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) pipeline designed to transform individual academic papers into their structured local Knowledge Graph (KG) representations. The pipeline leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly generative LLMs, to automate key Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in KGC.

This repository is related to the research "Open Local Knowledge Graph Construction from Academic Documents Using Generative Large Language Models". It contains the following components:
- ([link](./paper2lkg-v0/)) The research artifact, the paper2lkg pipeline. 
(The setup guide is included here)
- ([link](./paper2lkg-v0-testers/)) The research artifacts for evaluating paper2lkg. (The guide for reproducing the experiment results is included here)
- ([link](./documentation/pipeline-overview/)) A comprehensive discussion about the pipeline.
- ([link](./documentation/evaluation/)) A comprehensive discussion about the evaluation approaches.
- ([link](./paper2lkg-v0-testers/data/raw_results/)) Raw experiment results.
- ([link](./documentation/visualised-results/)) Visualised experiment results.
