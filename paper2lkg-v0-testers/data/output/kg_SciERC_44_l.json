    "The concept of meaning-entailing substitutability fits an objective measure for evaluating feature vector quality. This semantic criterion proposes a novel approach to word similarity measures, which yields superior feature vectors and better performance results. Motivated by this semantic criterion, we analyze the empirical quality of distributional word feature vectors and its impact on word similarity results. The new goal and evaluation criterion for word similarity measures has broader terms such as 'evaluation criterion' and 'criterion', fitting the needs of semantic-oriented NLP applications. We suggest a new goal and evaluation criterion for word similarity measures, which fits the needs of these applications."
