    "This paper describes FERRET, an interactive question-answering system designed for real-world environments. In turn, FERRET utilizes a novel approach to question-answering called predictive questioning, which attempts to identify users' questions and answers by analyzing their interactions with the system while gathering information related to a particular scenario."
