    "Our system, which describes a fully automatic face recognition system based on video sequences for training and recognition input, achieves nearly perfect recognition rates in challenging scenarios with extreme illumination, pose, and head motion variation. The objective of this work is to recognize faces using video sequences, which has a broader term as face recognition. Our system can be combined with photometric model of image formation and statistical model of generic face appearance variation for more accurate results. Furthermore, our fully automatic recognition system based on the proposed method recognizes faces using video sequences both for training and recognition input."
