    "To recover from inevitable tracking failures, we consider object detection as a global optimization problem and solve it via Adaptive Simulated Annealing. This approach avoids being trapped at local modes and is much faster than exhaustive search. Our numerical hybrid local and global mode-seeing tracker uses this method to redetect the object and renew the local tracker when necessary. Given an object model, we apply cluster analysis on the sampled parameter space to re-detect the object's location using a black-box measure of similarity between the model and candidate targets. This approach has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art trackers on the VIVID benchmark datasets.",
    "The object being tracked can become partially or totally occluded and requires recovery from tracking failures. Our approach, Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), stochastically samples the parameter space of translation, rotation, and scale to recover from such failures. ASA outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on VIVID benchmark datasets by using local optimization techniques under normal tracking conditions. Given an object model, we apply cluster analysis to group data into clusters based on their similarities or patterns."
