    "A bio-inspired model for an analog programmable array processor, also known as APAP, has permitted the realization of complex programmable spatio-temporal dynamics in VLSI. This model mimics the way images are processed in the visual pathway and enables complex spatial and temporal processing tasks. The design challenges and trade-offs involved in this project have been presented in a paper that showcases some experimental results. Furthermore, early vision applications can be implemented using standard technologies."
