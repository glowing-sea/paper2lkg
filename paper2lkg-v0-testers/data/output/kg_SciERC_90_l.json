    "Recent studies have shown that raised ASR accuracy for features derived from AN fibers can be achieved through improved auditory processing by onset neurons. This process, which occurs during encoding sound for neuronal processing, is crucial for OA to improve phase locking in the auditory nerve. In fact, a critical step in this process involves converting an analog pressure wave into discrete nerve-action potentials. Moreover, researchers have found that open access methods like OA can be used to improve phase locking and increase accuracy for features derived from AN fibers. Furthermore, studies using Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) than Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) suggest that these techniques are more effective in modeling complex relationships between inputs and outputs."
