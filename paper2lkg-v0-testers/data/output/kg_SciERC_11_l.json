    "The approach, validated by the externally digital architecture, utilizes high-density, low-power analog arrays performing binary-binary partial matrix-vector multiplication. This mixed-signal paradigm presents high-resolution parallel inner-product computation and is suitable for efficient implementation of kernels in image processing. The approach also maintains full digital resolution despite low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to be effective even with highly correlated inputs."
