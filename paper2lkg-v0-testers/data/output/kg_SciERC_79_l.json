    "Unconstrained MPS grammars are a type of grammar that combines context-free phrase structure rules and metarules, but lacks computational safety. They allow for concise statements about the syntax of natural languages. In contrast, MPS grammars have a broader term in new directions for research on alternative metagrammatical formalisms. We suggest exploring these new directions to constrain MPS grammars. However, we show that none of the proposals satisfies both criteria of explanatory adequacy and computational tractability. Instead, several proposals are proposed as solutions to this problem."
